.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgister\fR is a command line tool for managing GitHub gists\.
.
.P
Based on \fBgist\.rb\fR by defunkt, this tool helps you to manage a local copy of your gists\.
.
.P
After publishing files to gist\.github\.com, this tool will:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
automatically clone the gist repository to local
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
index the content of your gist for code search
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
fetch meta info (e\.g\. description, url) of the gist from GitHub and add them to \fBgists\.list\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
You can also use \fBgisetr\fR to sync your gists between gist\.github\.com and your machine\.
.
.SH "DEPENDENCIES"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
git

gist\.rb
.

.
.P
For Linux, BSD, etc, you also need \fBxclip\fR or \fBxsel\fR\. For Cygwin, you need putclip/getclip provided by cygutils\-extra\. (Mas OS X users should be fine with the preinstalled pbcopy/pbpaste\.)
.
.P
Note: \fBxsel\fR users should use \fBgist\.rb\fR v4\.1\.2+, since there is a bug bitting xsel users in previous versions\.
.
.SH "USAGE"
.
.SS "init"
For the first time, you need to run \fBgister init\fR to associate your GitHub account and configure the directory to store local copies of your gists\.
.
.P
After that, you may run \fBgister sync\fR to fetch all your gists to local\.
.
.P
Warn: \fBsync\fR can only fetch up to 10 million gists for you\. If you have more than 10 million gists, you need to modify the source of \fBgister\fR yourself\.
.
.SS "publish"
Whenever you want to publish a gist, just use
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

gister description file\.txt \.\.\.
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
This will create the gist with the provided description, clone the gist repo, put the gistid to clipborad, and open the url in your \fBx\-www\-browser\fR\.
.
.P
Note: you must provide gist description, otherwise \fBgister\fR will fail\.
.
.P
Hint: \fBgister\fR will pass all arguments to gist as \fBgist \-c \-o \-d description \.\.\.\fR, so you can use other options that gist understands, e\.g\. \fBgister descrption \-P\fR will work\.
.
.P
If you\'ve edited your gists at \fBgist\.github\.com\fR or local machine, without pull/push changesets, you can sync all your gists via \fBgister sync\fR\.
.
.SS "search"
Search all of your gists:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

gister search regexp
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "migrate"
From version 1\.0\.0, \fBgister\fR uses a different storage structure\. If you have used \fBgister <1\.0\.0\fR, then you need to run this command to migrate:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

gister migrate
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "STORAGE"
.
.nf
